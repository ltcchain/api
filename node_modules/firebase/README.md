firebase-node
===================

This is the node library for Firebase.
Firebase is a real-time data synchronization service designed to power collaborative applications.
You can learn more on the Firebase website at [www.firebase.com](https://www.firebase.com).

Getting started with the Firebase node client is easy. First, install the client library:

    npm install firebase
    
Next, you'll need to [create a Firebase account](https://www.firebase.com/signup) to get a URL for your Firebase data.

Lastly, create your Firebase in your code and write some data:

    var Firebase = require('firebase');
    var dataRef = new Firebase('https://myprojectname.firebaseIO-demo.com/');
    dataRef.set("hello world!");
